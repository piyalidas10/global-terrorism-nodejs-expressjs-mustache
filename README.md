# Deploy Nodejs application in Heroku
```
1. Create a Procfile to tell heroku how will run the application (web: node ./app.js)
2. So process.env.PORT || 3000 means: whatever is in the environment variable PORT, or 3000 if there's nothing there.

#JavaScript templating engines

### Some popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, and EJS. The Express application generator uses Jade as its default, but it also supports several others.

#### A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.
